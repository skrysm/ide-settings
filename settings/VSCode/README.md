## Settings Sync

Settings are synchronized via this extension: **[Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) by Shan Khan**

This stores the settings in a GitHub Gist named `History...entries.json` (title: Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist).

To see all your Gists, go to <https://gist.github.com>, click your profile picture and then click "Your gists".

### First Time Setup

After installing the extension, click on the **Login with GitHub** button.

Afterwards, select the **Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist**. Then, click "Close Tab".

Then, open the command palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) and execute: `Sync: Download Settings`

### Cloning a Gist

Normally, you don't need to clone the settings gist.

However, if you want to make a local backup or manually examine the changes made to the gist, you can clone a gist by using this URL (hidden under the **Embed** button):

    https://gist.github.com/GIST_ID.git
