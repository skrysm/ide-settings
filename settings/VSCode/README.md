# Settings for Visual Studio Code

Settings are synchronized via this extension: **[Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) by Shan Khan**

This stores the settings in a GitHub Gist named `cloudSettings` (title: Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist).

You can find it here: <https://gist.github.com> and click "See all of your gists".

## First Time Download

After installing the extension on a fresh Visual Studio Code installation, open the command palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P**) and execute: `Sync: Download Settings`

## Cloning a Gist

Normally, you don't need to clone the settings gist.

However, if you want to make a local backup or manually examine the changes made to the gist, you can clone a gist by using this URL (hidden under the **Embed** button):
